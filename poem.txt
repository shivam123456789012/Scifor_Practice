In the morning's tender light, the sun begins to rise,
Painting skies with hues of gold, a masterpiece in disguise.
The air, a crisp and gentle kiss, whispers secrets to the trees,
As nature dances in the breeze, carried on the playful tease.

Oh, the weather, an artist unseen,
Crafting scenes of wonder, a tranquil dream.
Whispers in the wind, tales untold,
A symphony of elements, a story to unfold.

Clouds, like poets in the sky, pen verses on the blue,
A canvas of emotions, in every shade and hue.
Raindrops fall like stardust, a celestial ballet,
Nature's tears or laughter, in each drop they say.

Oh, the weather, an artist unseen,
Crafting scenes of wonder, a tranquil dream.
Whispers in the wind, tales untold,
A symphony of elements, a story to unfold.

Thunder rolls like distant drums, a heartbeat of the storm,
Lightning sketches silhouettes, in shadows, takes its form.
Snowflakes weave a tapestry, a blanket soft and white,
Winter's hush, a lullaby, beneath the pale moonlight.

The seasons change, a carousel, spinning tales anew,
Springtime blooms in colors bright, a promise to pursue.
Summer's warmth embraces all, a sunlit, endless spree,
Autumn leaves in golden dress, a farewell, yet so free.

Oh, the weather, an artist unseen,
Crafting scenes of wonder, a tranquil dream.
Whispers in the wind, tales untold,
A symphony of elements, a story to unfold.

So listen to the weather's song, written in the air,
A melody of moments, beyond compare.
In rain or shine, in snow or sun,
The weather's tales are never done.
